  <title>Life Cycle of a Butterfly</title>
  <body>
    <h1> What does the life cycle of a butterfly consist of? </h1>
    <p> The life cycle of a butterfly consists of 5 distinct stages.</p>
    <h2> How long does it typically take to go from the egg to a full butterfly? </h2>
    <p> This process/cycle typically takes 4-5 weeks of development.</p>
    <h3>Why is it interesting?</h3>
    <p> I like learning about things in nature, such as the process of metamorphosis which is what
        the butterfly undergoes during this development process. It is one of the staples of science 
        throughout all years of education. Things in nature that occur in everyday life are partiuclarly
        interesting in learning about because it gives you a new perspective on everything that is going 
        on around you that you may not notice. I believe that understanding how things work, like in this 
        case HTML and how it works for making websites, allows people to have a better understanding of the 
        world around them.</p>
